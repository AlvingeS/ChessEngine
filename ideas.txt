Precompute attacking king moves?
Precompute king as if it were a rook, bishop, knight from all squares
lookup the current square and and it with the opponents pieces. If no hit, 
no calc. Otherwise we may lookup the hit pieces and see if they are the correct
attacking piece

Todo:
- Makemove should only apply a move, it should NOT update any search memory. Get a move and apply it on current state.
- Movegen should given the current state generate all moves. It should not be queried for information whether or
  not we are in check.
